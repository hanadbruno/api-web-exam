Creating a time management tool using, react and mongodb
Sure, here's a basic guide that you can include in your README file to help others set up and run your project:

## Setting Up and Running the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the Time Management Tool project.

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using a Git client or download the ZIP file.

### Backend (Server)

1. Navigate to the `Server` directory:
   ```
   cd Server
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The backend server should now be running on the specified port (default is 3001).

### Frontend (React App)

1. Navigate to the `Client` directory:
   ```
   cd Client
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React app:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The React app should now be running on a development server (default is 3000).

### Access the Application

You can now access the Time Management Tool application in your web browser:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API (if needed): [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
